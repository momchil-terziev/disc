# Discretisation uncertainty calculator
Uses the following methods to estimate the discretisation uncertianty based on a solution triplet:
- Grid Convergence Index
- Correction Factor Method
- Factors of Safety for Richardson Extrapolation 
Further information about the methods can be accessed in the [ITTC guide](https://www.ittc.info/media/8153/75-03-01-01.pdf) or in my [uncertainty paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2020.107434), a free copy can be found [here](https://momchil-terziev.github.io/publication/2020-aposteriori-paper)
